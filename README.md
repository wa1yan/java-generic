# Java Generic Example


### Write a generic method to count the number of elements in a collection that have a specific property (for example, odd integers, prime numbers, palindromes).

##### This project is answer for above question.

  1. **Odd number** is a number which is not divisible by 2.
    formula is number % 2 != 0.
  
  2. **Prime number** is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1
  eg. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 ( 1 to 100 ).
  
  3. **Palindromes number** is a number (such as 343) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
